# Huff By Example

Huff is a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts
that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

To get started locally, [install the huffc compiler](https://github.com/huff-language/huffc#prerequisities).

Once the compiler is installed, here are some examples.

- [Hello World]() - Hello World, a timeless classic.

- [Variables]() - Variables and constants.

- [Macros]() - Macros, not to be confused with functions!

- [Interfaces](./interfaces.md) - The external contract interface (ABI).

- [Imports]() - Importing other functionality.

- [EVM Dialect]() - EVM opcode reference and usage.

- [Applications](./applications.md) - Applications and project structure.

- [Testing](./testing.md) - Testing Huff contracts.
